SDK reference documentation is available in [this README](doc/README.md)

### Prerequisites
To use this SDK, you need an App SID and an App Key; they can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) (it requires free registration in Aspose Cloud for this).

### Installation
You can use it directly in your project via the source code or get a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@asposecloud/aspose-email-cloud)
From the command line:

	npm install @asposecloud/aspose-email-cloud --save

See more details about SDK installation in this tutorial: [SDK setup](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/emailcloud/SDK+setup)

### Usage examples
To use the API, you should create an EmailApi object:
```typescript
var appKey = "Your App Key";
var appSid = "Your App SID";
var api = new EmailApi(appSid, appKey);
```

#### Business cards recognition API

Use `AiBcrParseModel` method to parse business card image to VCard DTO:

```typescript
var imageData = fs.readFileSync("/tmp/alex.png").toString('base64');
var result = await api.aiBcrParseModel(new requests.AiBcrParseModelRequest(
    new models.AiBcrBase64Rq(
        undefined, [new models.AiBcrBase64Image(true, imageData)])));
var contact = result.body.value[0];
```

See more details [here](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/emailcloud/Parse+Image+To+VCard+File) and [here](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/emailcloud/Business+Cards+Recognition+API)
